## Introduction
Tired of comparing availability with every member for a group project or meeting? Meet & Cheese simplifies the process of finding the mutual availability times in a group trying to schedule a meeting time. Beyond seeing multiple group member's availability in one screen (pulled directly from their Google Calendars), Meet & Cheese also allows meeting organizers to select a final meeting time & send Google Calendar invitations to all meeting members.

## Usage

#### Setup

1 - Clone the master repository <br>```git clone https://github.com/cs35lproject/cs35l_project.git``` <br>
2 - Install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) <br>
3 - Open two terminals and navigate to the cloned repository, each will install the dependencies and run the corresponding code. <br>

| server terminal  | client terminal |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| ```cd cs35l_project/server``` | ```cd cs35l_project/client ``` |
| ``` npm install ``` | ``` npm install ``` |
| ``` npm run dev ``` | ``` npm start ``` |

#### Testing Phase

Until Meet & Cheese is considered an [officially verified](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865) app by Google, users will have to send the email corresponding to the calendar they want to use (send to ```sebastian01cevallos@gmail.com```) in order to be included in the testing phase.

## Launch
Node.js v18.14.0 <br>
