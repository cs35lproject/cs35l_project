# <a name="title" /> Meet & Cheese

## Introduction
Tired of comparing availability all the time? Meet & Cheese simplifies the process of finding the mutual availability times in a group trying to schedule a meeting time. Beyond seeing multiple group member's availability in one screen (pulled directly from their Google Calendars), Meet & Cheese also allows meeting organizers to select a final meeting time & send Google Calendar invitations to all meeting members.
